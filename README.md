# Fraud Detection System ðŸš¨

## Overview
This project detects fraudulent transactions in credit card data using **Random Forest** and **SMOTE** for class balancing.  
The dataset is highly imbalanced (frauds are rare), so we use oversampling techniques to improve model performance.

## Features
- Preprocessing & scaling of features
- Oversampling using SMOTE
- Random Forest model training
- Performance evaluation with **classification report** and **ROC-AUC**

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from Kaggle:  
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
